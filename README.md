## Algorithmic Trading Bot Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the key phases and steps to build, test, and deploy an algorithmic trading bot that uses a predictive model.

---

### Phase 1: Foundation & Simple Strategy

The goal of this phase is to build the basic scaffolding for the bot and implement a simple, rule-based strategy.

- [x] **Step 1.1: Setup Development Environment**
  - [x] Install Python and necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`).
  - [x] Set up a version control system like Git.
  - [x] Choose an IDE (like VS Code).

- [ ] **Step 1.2: Create a Basic Trading Bot Structure**
  - [ ] Create separate modules for the bot logic, exchange interactions, and utilities.
  - [ ] Implement placeholder functions for fetching prices and placing orders.

- [ ] **Step 1.3: Implement a Simple Trading Strategy**
  - [ ] Code a basic strategy, such as a moving average crossover or a simple price threshold system (like the one in `trading_bot_template.py`).

---

### Phase 2: Historical Backtesting

This phase focuses on testing the simple strategy against historical data to gauge its viability.

- [ ] **Step 2.1: Acquire Historical Market Data**
  - [ ] Use a library like `yfinance` or `ccxt` to download historical price data (OHLCV - Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
  - [ ] Store the data in a consistent format (e.g., CSV or a database).

- [ ] **Step 2.2: Develop a Backtesting Engine**
  - [ ] Create a script (`backtest.py`) that iterates through the historical data point-by-point.
  - [ ] Simulate the execution of your strategy, tracking a virtual portfolio (cash, assets, PnL).
  - [ ] Log every simulated trade (entry/exit price, timestamp, amount).

- [ ] **Step 2.3: Analyze Backtest Results**
  - [ ] Calculate key performance metrics:
    - [ ] Total Profit/Loss (PnL)
    - [ ] Win/Loss Ratio
    - [ ] Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted return)
    - [ ] Maximum Drawdown (largest peak-to-trough decline)

### Phase 3: Building the Predictive Model

Here, you will build a machine learning model to forecast future price movements.

- [ ] **Step 3.1: Feature Engineering**
  - [ ] From your historical data, create features that the model can learn from. Examples include:
    - [ ] Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
    - [ ] Lagged price values
    - [ ] Volatility measures

- [ ] **Step 3.2: Choose and Train a Model**
  - [ ] Select an appropriate ML model (e.g., LSTM for time-series, XGBoost for tabular data, Facebook Prophet).
  - [ ] Split your data into training and testing sets.
  - [ ] Train the model on the training data to predict a target (e.g., the price in the next period, or whether the price will go up or down).

- [ ] **Step 3.3: Evaluate Model Performance**
  - [ ] Test the trained model on the unseen testing data.
  - [ ] Evaluate its accuracy using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or a classification confusion matrix.

---

### Phase 4: Integrated Backtesting with Predictive Model

Combine the predictive model with the backtesting engine to see if its forecasts improve the strategy's performance.

- [ ] **Step 4.1: Modify the Backtesting Engine**
  - [ ] Integrate the trained model into your backtester. The backtester should feed historical data to the model to generate a prediction for the *next* time step.

- [ ] **Step 4.2: Refine the Trading Strategy**
  - [ ] Modify your strategy logic to use the model's predictions as a primary signal.
  - [ ] Example: "If the model predicts the price will rise by >1% AND the RSI is not overbought, then buy."

- [ ] **Step 4.3: Run and Analyze the Predictive Backtest**
  - [ ] Run the new, prediction-driven strategy against your historical data.
  - [ ] Compare the performance metrics against the results from the simple strategy in Phase 2. Did the model add value?

### Phase 5: Paper Trading (Forward Testing)

Before risking real money, test the bot in a live, simulated environment.

- [ ] **Step 5.1: Connect to a Broker/Exchange API**
  - [ ] Choose an exchange that offers a paper trading (or "sandbox") environment.
  - [ ] Write the code to connect to the exchange's API, replacing your placeholder functions.

- [ ] **Step 5.2: Adapt Bot for Live Data**
  - [ ] Modify your bot to handle a live stream of data (websockets) or poll for new data at regular intervals.
  - [ ] Ensure your model can generate predictions in real-time.

- [ ] **Step 5.3: Run and Monitor**
  - [ ] Run the bot in the paper trading environment for an extended period (weeks or months).
  - [ ] Compare its performance to the backtest results. The real world often presents unexpected challenges (slippage, API latency).

---

### Phase 6: Live Deployment (Use Extreme Caution)

This is the final step where the bot trades with real capital.

- [ ] **Step 6.1: Set Up a Secure Production Environment**
  - [ ] Deploy the bot on a reliable server or cloud service (e.g., AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean) to ensure it runs 24/7.
  - [ ] Secure your API keys and credentials.

- [ ] **Step 6.2: Implement Robust Risk Management**
  - [ ] Code hard limits into your bot:
    - [ ] **Position Sizing:** Never risk more than a small percentage of your capital on a single trade.
    - [ ] **Stop-Loss:** Automatically exit a trade if it loses a certain amount.
    - [ ] **Kill Switch:** A way to manually or automatically shut down all trading activity.

- [ ] **Step 6.3: Go Live with Minimal Capital**
  - [ ] Start with the smallest amount of capital you are willing to lose.
  - [ ] Monitor its performance closely.

### Phase 7: Continuous Improvement

A trading bot is never "finished." The market is always changing.

- [ ] **Step 7.1: Ongoing Monitoring and Logging**
  - [ ] Keep detailed logs of all trades, decisions, and errors.
  - [ ] Set up alerts for unexpected behavior.

- [ ] **Step 7.2: Regular Model Retraining**
  - [ ] Periodically retrain your predictive model with new market data to prevent "model drift."

- [ ] **Step 7.3: Strategy Refinement**
  - [ ] Use the data from live trading and paper trading to continuously analyze and refine your strategy.
